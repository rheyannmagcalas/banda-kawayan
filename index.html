            <p>distinct and unique musical styles. With its ability to perform various musical genres combined with imaginative and lively choreography, the group has won the hearts of its audiences regardless of musical persuasions and inclinations. A repertoire consisting of more than one hundred songs and arrangements has been rendered to a profuse mix of faces and places. From well-loved kundimans, folk songs and classical hymns to contemporary jazz pieces, pop songs, and all-time hits, the band plays them all with a punch. OUR MUSICIANS: Starting as early as the age of eleven, the members, regardless of their musical inclination or background, are taught how to put the instruments to good use. Trained for a year, they learn the fundamental musical pieces and basic choreography as they are gradually integrated into the group as senior members. Little by little, they are allowed to join major productions and eventually primed for overseas engagements or concert tours. There are currently about fifty (50) active band members consisting of high school and college students, as well as young professionals with a passion for music and the performing arts. OUR REPERTOIRE: The band’s repertoire consists of a diverse array of local and foreign tunes. From classical pieces to popular music, from jazz hits to all time favorite ballroom dance tunes, the band caters to all music aficionados. Their local tunes are a blend of well-loved musical pieces and contemporary songs. “Bahay Kubo”, for example, is a Tagalog folk song simply depicting, in a jolly melody, a rustic “nipa” hut with different crops planted around it. “Lolay”, a harana or serenade, reveals the romantic nature of Filipinos. “Lahat ng Araw (Silayan)” and “Dahil sa ‘Yo” are prime examples of another romantic musical form called the kundiman. Also included in the group’s repertoire are lively regional folk songs that celebrate the beauty and diversity of the Philippine islands. Songs like “Pamulinawen” from the Ilocos region in the North, “Sarung Banggi” from the Bicol region in Southern Luzon, “Waray, Waray”, “Ay, Ay Kalisud” and “Dandansoy” from the Visayas islands and “Zamboanga” from the Mindanao region. Pop hits from notable Filipino artists, such as Gary Valenciano’s “’Di Na Natuto” and Ryan Cayabyab’s “Kailan” are among the many songs representing Original Pilipino Music (OPM). Having been exposed to various cultures all over the world, the group likewise offers a wide selection of well-loved tunes. For instance, the band performs such songs as “Waltzing Matilda” from Australia, “Chisai Yaki” from Japan, “Mou Li Hua” from China, “O Sole Mio” from Italy, “La Paloma” from Spain. “Muss I Denn (Wooden Heart)” from Germany, “Kunbam Taryong” from South Korea among others. The band also offers its unique interpretations of classical pieces like excerpts from Charles Gounod’s opera, “Faust” and the lively “Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka” from Johann Strauss. Jazz hits include Chuck Mangione’s “Feel so Good” and the classic “Take Five” from Dave Brubeck. There are the sought-after movie themes such as “Axel F” (Beverly Hills Cop). “(I’ve Had The) Time of My Life” (Dirty Dancing) and “I Will Always Love You” (The Bodyguard). Ballroom dance numbers include “In the Mood”, “Never On a Sunday” and “Mambo Jambo”. Marching tunes like “Radetzky March” and revered hymns such as “America the Beautiful” are also performed by the band. To keep up with the times, the band continues to include popular tunes, Top 40 Hits and most requested songs in its ever-evolving repertoire.</p>

            <p>The group traces its roots from a school-based group established in 1973 by then Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) Laboratory High School principal Gloria R. Talastas and faculty member Prof. Siegfredo B. Calabig. The PCC was eventually renamed Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) and the group has since been known as PUP Banda Kawayan until 2013, when the group celebrated its 40th Anniversary.

            <h2>Professor Siegfredo "Ka Fred" Baldemor Calabig</h2><br>
            <p>
              Prof. Siegfredo Baldemor Calabig (affectionately referred to as Ka Fred) comes from a musically inclined family based in the town of Paete in Laguna province, noted for its skilled craftsmen and artisans. In fact, the town's name, Paete, was named after 'paet', the Filipino word for a carpenter's chisel. <br><br>

              His first music teachers were his very own parents. His mother taught him how to read notes (solfeggio) when he was seven years old while his father (himself a professional musician and carpenter) taught him how to play brass instruments, particularly the trumpet and the French horn starting as early as nine years old. Together with his two other brothers, Ka Fred would join his father"s brass band and get exposed to the life of a musician. Because his family could not afford to send him to the Conservatory of Music and pursue his dream career, he went on to obtain a degree in secondary education.
              <br><br>
              He was hired as a music teacher at the high school department of the then Philippine College of Commerce (now the Polytechnic University of the Philippines) and was requested by the high school principal, Mrs. Gloria R.Talastas, to start an orchestra. 
              <br><br>
              His initial idea of setting up a drum and bugle corps proved to be too expensive so the principal suggested that he form a bamboo orchestra instead. At first, Ka Fred was reluctant to accept the job since he had no background whatsoever with making instruments, much less with bamboo. However, he was eventually convinced to give it a try, given his background in music and carpentry. 
            </p>

          <div class="col-lg-7">
              <p>
              <br><br>
              After countless hours of experimentation, Ka Fred was able to come up with his initial prototypes and through the years have developed his own unique set of instruments from different types of bamboo sourced from all over the Philippines combined with other indigenous materials. With his boundless curiosity, innovation and creativity, he continues to produce new bamboo-based instruments.
              <br><br>
              In his desire to share his passion for promoting music and the widespread use of bamboo and indigenous materials, he has collaborated with other organizations from both the public and private sectors by supplying them with bamboo instruments and training them to start their own bamboo-based performing groups.

              <p>
                Angklung is a traditional Asian instrument, variations of which can be found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The angklung provides counterpoints to the melody. Each angklung represents a note and is played by shaking the lower part with one hand while holding the upper end steady.

            <p>
              Bumbong are hollow pieces of bamboo put together and serve as the orchestra’s wind section — divided into “bass” (lower) and “horn” (higher) sections. The smaller the bamboo, the higher the note. Each piece of bamboo represents one note and is blown through a mouthpiece to produce the sound.

              <p>
                The marimba provides the melody. Made from bamboo and Philippine hardwood, it follows the musical scale and style of the typical xylophone and a marimba in an orchestra. Mallets made out of rattan and rubber are used to play the instrument. Similar to a piano, there’s a higher, middle and lower scale.

              <p>
                Panpipes are small pieces of bamboo put together by a string and is similar in sound and stylings of the wind instruments found in Northern Philippines and in South America. Each piece of bamboo represents a note and is blown to produce the sound. The fan pipes provide counterpoints to the basic melody.

              <p>
                Kalagong is a wind instrument which also provides bass and sometimes the melody for select musical pieces. Bamboo poles each representing a note are held together by a wooden frame and are played when two paddles made of rubber slippers are struck on each of the hollow bamboo tubes. The name of the instrument comes from the first two syllables of the conductor’s name “kala” and the “gong” for the gong-like sound that it produces when struck by the paddle.

            <p>
              Kalatok is a percussion instrument, with pieces of bamboo with varying tones strung together. The instrument’s name was derived from the first two syllables of the conductor’s surname “Kala” and the“tok” sound that it produces when struck by a rubber mallet.

            </center>
            <p>
              Kiskis is a bamboo piece with ridges and serves as a percussion instrument. “Kiskis” is a Filipino word for “to scratch” or “to rub against something”. It is played by “rubbing” a rattan stick on its ridges.
